# Sudoku-Solver
This project is able to solve any 9x9 Sudoku puzzle board, given that it is in fact solvable. To use the Sudoku puzzle solver:

(1) Clone the repository.

(2) Obtain your own free API key here: https://rapidapi.com/sosier/api/solve-sudoku/.

(3) In the ".env_sample" file, replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with the obtained API key. Then, rename the file to ".env"

(4) In your terminal, navigate to the working directory of the project. Run "npm init," and click enter until it says "username@device-name Sudoku_Solver %"

(5) Connect the backend by executing "npm run start:backend." The frontend should now be connected to the backend, and the API should work.

(6) Open the "index.html" file.

To use the solver more than once, refresh the page to enter another puzzle.
